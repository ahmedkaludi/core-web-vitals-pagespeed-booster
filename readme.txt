== Description ==
<h4>Core Web Vitals is the new ranking factor</h4>

Google announced that "Core Web Vitals" are going to be a significant ranking signal for websites. In fact, Core Web Vitals or the page experience signal is going to become a requirement for a page to appear in Google's Top Stories.

### Features

* <strong>Webp images</strong>: If images are slowing down your website, then converting them to WebP format can improve your page load speed test scores. 
* <strong>Lazy Load</strong>: Lazy loading allows your website to only load images when a user scrolls down to a specific image, which reduces website load time and improves website performance.
* <strong>Minification</strong>: If you are trying to achieve 100/100 score on Google Pagespeed or GTMetrix tool, then minifying CSS and JavaScript will significantly improve your score.
* <strong>Remove Unused CSS</strong>:Unused CSS is any CSS code added by your WordPress theme or plugins that you donâ€™t really need. Removing this CSS code improves WordPress performance and user experience.
* <strong>Google Fonts Optimizations</strong>: You may start noticing external resources like fonts affecting Google PageSpeed + load times. This is where loading Google Fonts locally comes into play.
* <strong>Delay JavaScript Execution</strong>:You can delay JavaScript based on user interaction. This can be a great way to speed up the paint of the page for Google PageSpeed when something isn't needed right away. Especially heavy third-party scripts like Google Adsense, Google Analytics etc.
* <strong>Cache</strong>: Caching is one of the most important and easiest ways to speed up WordPress! it reduces the amount of work required to generate a page view. As a result, your web pages load much faster, directly from cache.
