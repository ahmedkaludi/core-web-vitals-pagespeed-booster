# Installing cwebp using official precompilations

Official precompilations are available [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled). Since `WebPConvert` compares each binary's checksum first, you will have to change the checksums hardcoded in `Converters/Cwebp.php` if you want to replace any of them. If you feel the need of using another binary, please let us know - chances are that it should be added to the project!
